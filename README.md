# UCS761 – Deep Learning Lab Assignments

This repository contains implementations of two Deep Learning lab assignments for the course **UCS761**.  
Both labs focus on understanding core machine learning models by implementing them **from scratch using NumPy**, without relying on high-level deep learning libraries.

## 🧪 Lab 3: Logistic Regression as a Soft Decision Model

📘 **Notebook:**  
[Logistic_Regression_Soft_Decision_Model.ipynb](./Logistic_Regression_Soft_Decision_Model.ipynb)

### Objective
To understand logistic regression as a **soft decision model** that outputs probabilities instead of hard class labels.

### Key Concepts
- Sigmoid function and probability output
- Binary Cross-Entropy loss
- Gradient Descent learning
- Effect of decision thresholds
- Difference between perceptron and logistic regression

## 🧪 Lab 4: Multiple Linear Regression using a Linear Perceptron

📘 **Notebook:**  
[Multi_Linear_Regression_via_Linear_Perceptron.ipynb](./Multi_Linear_Regression_via_Linear_Perceptron.ipynb)

### Objective
To implement **multiple linear regression** using a linear perceptron trained with **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

### Key Concepts
- Numeric prediction vs classification
- Linear forward pass (no activation)
- MSE loss and gradient computation
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Smooth interpolation of predictions

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

> The same perceptron model can perform classification or regression by changing only the **loss function** and **output interpretation**.
